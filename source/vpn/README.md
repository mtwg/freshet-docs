# Using Remote Access \(VPN\)

## Why a VPN?

The primary reasons we are using a VPN for all offsite collaborators are:

* to encrypt your internet traffic
* to obscure the source of your internet traffic
* to ensure that \_protected services \_are only exposed to trusted users

> _**Note:**_ Currently, protected services are available without the VPN temporarily until everyone who will need them is familiar with and using the VPN

## Why protect services?

1. **Visibility** Currently, anyone can visit freshetdata.org. This means that potential attackers don't need credentials to begin looking for ways to gain access to the server using a variety of methods. We try our best to prevent these attacks, but ensuring that only a short list of users can even see freshetdata.org gives us many advantages in protecting our data.
2. **Encrypted Traffic**
   It ensures another layer of encryption in addition to SSL. Though SSL is the best in-transit encryption method available for the web, a diversity of encryption tactics is always key, especially since barely a year goes by before a major SSL vulnerability is discovered.
